### Problem 3
### Write a Python program to display the first and last 
### colors from the following list.
color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black","Blue","Yellow"]

print ("Problem 3 solution follows:")

#I don't think this needs to be elegant...

print(f"First on the list: {color_list[0]}")    #Index 0 is the first item
print(f"Last on the list {color_list[-1]}")     #Index -1 is always the last item (Unless it isn't because I'm stupid)
