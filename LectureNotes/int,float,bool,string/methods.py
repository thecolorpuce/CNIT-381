""" 
A method in Python behaves similarly to a function. Methods actually are functions that are called using dot notation. For example, lower() is a string method that can be used like this, on a string called "sample string": sample_string.lower().

Methods are specific to the data type for a particular variable. So there are some built-in methods that are available for all strings, different methods that are available for all integers, etc.
